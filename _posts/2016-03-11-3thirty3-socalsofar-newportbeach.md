(333 Bayside Dr, Newport Beach, CA 92660 - www.3thirty3nb.com) ..oh how I love you.. the music, the drinks, the martinis, the fact you are open until 2am on a Saturday.. and the staff. Even though all the photos here seem to be about the drinks, it's also a restaurant with awesome food. It's one of those places again where you really need to try - and it can be so hard - to get a seat at the bar..\_"

3Thirty3.. (333 Bayside Dr, Newport Beach, CA 92660 - www.3thirty3nb.com) ..oh how I love you.. the music, the drinks, the martinis, the fact you are open until 2am on a Saturday.. and the staff. Even though all the photos here seem to be about the drinks, it's also a restaurant with awesome food. It's one of those places again where you really need to try - and it can be so hard - to get a seat at the bar.. I bow down to you 3Thirty3, now get me another dirty martini....
